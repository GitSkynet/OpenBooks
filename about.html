                <h1>OpenBooks V1</h1>
                <p>The idea of â€‹â€‹OpenBooks was born from the need to obtain resources from both computer programming and specific languages and the technological world in general, offering free books and direct download.
                    All managed through the OpenLibra API, which offers us a vast library of online books that we can consume.
                    This project is designed to be able to have a website where we can go when any programming question arises,
                    we need guides or HOW-TO'S on how to program in a specific language or simply, we want to expand our knowledge on the subject.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <h1>But...Whats is OpenLibra? ðŸ“‹</h1>
                <p>OpenLibra has a lightweight web service with which it is possible to remotely access most of the data in its bibliographic catalog, currently with a library of !! +3500 books !!

                    Through an AJAX (Javascript) request, you can establish a direct connection with the system and obtain results in real time on the query. The system returns a JSON object with which it is easy to work directly in Javascript or in other server languages â€‹â€‹such as PHP or Java.
                    
                    This first version of the API facilitates the creation of independent clients for OpenLibra, such as desktop, that allow you to crawl the catalog in real time in search of news, create notifications with updates, classify and search for books according to a specific criteria or facilitate the reading documents directly online without a browser.</p>

                <h1>Â¿Why OpenLibra? ðŸ”©</h1>
                <p>As a web developer, I often need to turn to the Internet to find information about the technologies I work with. Most of the time, an entry in a specialized blog or a simple comment in a forum is enough to point me in the right direction to follow.

                    However, at other times, there is no better resource for learning than a good book or manual. The Internet is full of bibliographic material but it is not always easy to find it gathered in one place. Often we will find ourselves carrying out several searches that put us on the track of one or another interesting document or that adapts to our specific needs. And this is especially difficult and even frustrating when, in addition to information, we want it to also be free.
                    
                    The commercial strategies of publishers and the large number of pages that offer books for direct download in an illegitimate way, make it very difficult to access resources of interest when we use a search engine. Most of the material that we will find will be references to stores, a review in a forum, perhaps a glance at the first pages of an interesting title or directly a link to a content protected by copyright.
                    
                    It is because of everything that, knowing the effort made by many authors, the large amount of material they produce under free licenses, and its high general quality, OpenLibra was born. The idea behind this project is to try to gather in the same place, the greatest quantity of quality bibliographic resources, paying special interest to those written in the Spanish language. In this way, anyone who has the need to consult a book, or download it quietly to print or read it on their favorite device, can access this service and carry out their searches in a comfortable and categorized way.
                    
                    If you find something you like among the entire catalog, don't hesitate to pick it up.
                    
                    All the books that make up this library are free and, therefore, they are yours ... they belong to everyone.</p>
