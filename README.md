# OpenBooks V1

The idea of ​​OpenBooks was born from the need to obtain resources from both computer programming and specific languages
and the technological world in general, offering free books and direct download.
All managed through the OpenLibra API, which offers us a vast library of online books that we can consume.
This project is designed to be able to have a website where we can go when any programming question arises,
we need guides or HOW-TO'S on how to program in a specific language or simply, we want to expand our knowledge on the subject.
